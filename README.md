# rf-phase2-Web_Developer-divya_kyatamwar
This repository contains my Phase 2 internship work for Web Development. It includes theory notes, practical tasks like building a responsive multi‑page business website with form validation, API integration, and loading states, plus organized folders for documentation, screenshots, and reports.

## 📖 Intermediate Tasks & Progress  

During this phase, I focused on building a responsive **Online Food Ordering Website**. The project allowed me to strengthen my front‑end development skills by working on UI design, layout structuring, and integrating dynamic features with JavaScript. I also practiced organizing repositories, debugging issues, and ensuring mobile responsiveness. This journey gave me hands‑on experience in creating a user‑friendly web application from scratch.  

### Key Highlights  
- Set up a new GitHub repository with a README and organized folders for structured development.  
- Learned the basics of UI design and applied them to a food ordering app.  
- Planned and structured website pages (Home, About, Services, Contact) and finalized API usage.  
- Built the project folder and file structure with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.  
- Designed navigation menus (desktop and mobile) with responsive layouts.  
- Developed hero and services sections with styled typography, buttons, and responsive cards.  
- Created a dynamic menu section by fetching product data from `product.json` using JavaScript.  
- Implemented cart functionality — add to cart, quantity updates, total price calculation, and item removal.  
- Integrated Swiper.js for customer review sliders with smooth navigation and responsiveness.  
- Focused on mobile responsiveness, debugging issues, and refining interactions for better usability.  
- Cleaned and refactored JavaScript code, fixed minor bugs, and performed final testing to ensure full functionality.
